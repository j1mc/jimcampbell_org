Hi. Welcome to this website. I somehow managed to snag this domain name and
turn it into a crafty Linux systems-related site. So let's see how it goes.

Since you're here, you may be interested in learning something
[about me](/about) or perhaps you'd like to learn something about how
[this site gets put together](/about-site) *(spoiler alert: It's mostly built by
cats).*

In any case, thanks for visiting. I hope you find some userful posts.
