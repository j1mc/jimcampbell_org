There's a nifty new software-freedom-related podcast out now called
[LibreLounge](https://librelounge.org/), and I've just given it an
enjoyable first listen. The innaugral episode was published just over a week ago,
and covers corporate control of free software, org-mode, mobile phones and
PDAs.

It's hosted by [Christopher Lemmer Webber](https://dustycloud.org) and
[Serge Wroclawski](https://blog.emacsen.net/), and covers quite a bit of
ground. To go along with the podcast itself, they also provide a handy
[summary of the topics they cover](https://librelounge.org/episodes/episode-1-corporate-control-org-mode-mobile-phones-and-pdas.html)
on the main page for the episode.

Chris and Serge come off with a good mix of being well-informed and serious
about their topic without taking themselves too seriously (yet still managing
to keep it from becoming too-jokey). I recommend giving the podcast a listen
if you want to stay up on Free software and Free culture happenings.
