I've put this site together using a combination of the
[Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io) and the
[Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io). With regards to Hugo, I've taken
advantage of some of the more advanced and interesting Hugo features,
including [page resources](https://gohugo.io),
[SCSS compilation](https://gohugo.io), and
[image processing](https://gohugo.io).

Many thanks to the writers of the excellent
[Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and the
[Bulma documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/) for giving me the
resources to create this site. Many additional thanks to the authors of a
[few selected](https://github.com/solutionroute/hugo-smorg)
[Hugo themes](https://github.com/sudorook/capsule) that also use the Bulma CSS
framework. Without this documentation and these examples, this site would
still be here, but it would look worse.

You can view the [site sources on Github](https://github.com/j1mc/jimorg).

#### Hosting It

There are less-administratively burdensome hosting options out there, but (as a
Linux admin) I host this on a cloud server. I use Nginx +
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) to get you the pages securely.
