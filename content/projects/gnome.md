I've contributed to the GNOME project primarily through documentation, being
one of about a dozen people who wrote most of the initial GNOME 3.0 help.
I've also written most of the *gedit* documentation, and have contributed
documentation to the *GNOME System Administrators Guide*,
*GNOME Passwords and Keys*, *GNOME Terminal*, and *Deja Dup*.
